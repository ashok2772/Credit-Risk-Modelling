# Credit Risk Modelling using Machine Learning

The main aim of this project is to explore the dataset and discuss some interesting observations through visualizations and train machine learning models to predict the probabilty of default (PD), Loss given default (LGD) and Exposure at default (EAD) based on various features using supervised learning.

## Dataset

The dataset contains all available data for more than 800,000 consumer loans issued from 2007 to 2015 by Lending Club: a large US peer-to-peer lending company. There are several different versions of this dataset. 

## Models

Models:
For PD, I have used logistic regression
For LGD, There is two stage approach. 1) Logistic Regression and 2) Linear Regression
For EAD, I have trained linear regression

EL =  PD x LGD x EAD
## Libraries Used

 -Pandas
 -Numpy
 -Matplotlib
